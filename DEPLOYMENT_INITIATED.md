2. Under **Source**, select: **GitHub Actions**
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment (2-5 minutes)
The workflow will:
- ✅ Install dependencies
- ✅ Build your React app
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 4: Access Your Live Site
Once complete, visit:
```
https://heshamdan87.github.io/final-project-irad-septempet-october-2025-hesham-aldandan

## ⚠️ Important: Backend Configuration

Your frontend is now deployed, but you need to configure the backend URL.

### Current Setup
The app is configured to use `http://localhost:5000` for API calls, which won't work in production.

### Solution: Deploy Your Backend

#### Option 1: Railway (Recommended - Easiest)
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click **"New Project"** → **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Select your repository
5. Configure:
   - Root directory: `syriana-student-app/backend`
   - Start command: `node server.js`
6. Add environment variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_generated_jwt_secret
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
7. Deploy!

#### Option 2: Render (Free Tier)
1. Go to: https://render.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create **New Web Service**
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure:
   - Root directory: `syriana-student-app/backend`
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Start command: `node server.js`
6. Add environment variables (same as above)

#### Option 3: Heroku
Follow the guide in `GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

### Update Frontend API URL

Once your backend is deployed, update the frontend:

**File:** `syriana-student-app/frontend/src/services/api.js`

Find:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000';
```

Change to:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'https://your-backend-url.railway.app';
```

Then redeploy:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\hesha\Desktop\New folder (3)\final-project-irad-septempet-october-2025-hesham-aldandan"
git add .
git commit -m "Update API URL for production"
git push origin main
```

## 🗄️ MongoDB Atlas Setup (Required)

Your app needs a cloud database. Set up MongoDB Atlas (FREE):

1. **Create Account:** https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. **Create Cluster:** Choose M0 Free tier
3. **Create Database User:**
   - Username: `syriana-admin`
   - Password: (generate strong password)
   - Role: Atlas Admin
4. **Whitelist IPs:** Allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
5. **Get Connection String:**
   ```
   mongodb+srv://syriana-admin:PASSWORD@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/Syrian-Students-Registration-System?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

---

## 🛠️ Manual Deployment (Alternative)

You can also deploy manually anytime:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\hesha\Desktop\New folder (3)\final-project-irad-septempet-october-2025-hesham-aldandan\syriana-student-app\frontend"
npm run deploy
```

This will build and deploy directly to GitHub Pages.

## 🎨 Customization

### Add Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Buy a domain from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.
2. Go to: https://github.com/Heshamdan87/final-project-irad-septempet-october-2025-hesham-aldandan/settings/pages
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update DNS settings with your domain provider

### Update App Title/Description
Edit: `syriana-student-app/frontend/public/index.html`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: 404 Error
**Solution:** The deployment might still be in progress. Wait 5 minutes and refresh.

### Issue: Blank Page
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Likely API connection issues.

### Issue: API Calls Failing
**Solution:** Deploy your backend and update the API URL in the frontend.

### Issue: Deployment Failed
**Solution:** 
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Look for build errors
3. Fix errors and push again
